jquery.comments
===============

## What is jQuery contextual comments? ##
There's a lot of plugins to add comments on a text but honestly it's always the same archaic way. The Medium's Platform has experiment a new type of comments : comments linked to a paragraph, an image, a list or a simple word... contextual comments. Mmmkay and? And that's all but it's a lot. With this kind of comments, you can trace back missprints, say that you like or dislike some parts and last but not the least, all of your comments become a conversation. Try it and you'll never come back to forum's comments style.
